# EncryptedMessaging
Test project to illustrate how encrypted messaging might look

1. Generate public/private key pair by any method you trust. A simple generator is included, which outputs as .pem files
2. Write some short message in "MyMessageFile". This could in principle also be some image or video file
3. Encrypt message by running EncryptMessage.py
4. Decrypt message by running DecryptMessage.py
